NFT Tickets Marketplace Project
Overview
Welcome to the NFT Tickets Marketplace Project! This innovative platform leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize how tickets for events and travel are bought, sold, and traded. By utilizing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), we ensure ticket authenticity, enhance security, and offer a transparent resale process, benefiting both event organizers and attendees.

Features
Secure Ticketing: Each ticket is minted as a unique NFT, ensuring its authenticity and making it tamper-proof.
Transparent Resales: Smart contracts automate resale processes, allowing original event organizers to set price caps and receive a percentage of secondary sales.
User-Friendly Platform: Designed with a focus on user experience, making buying and selling NFT tickets straightforward for everyone.
Event and Travel Integration: Supports a wide range of events, including concerts, sports, conferences, and travel tickets.
